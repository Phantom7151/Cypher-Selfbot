# FAQ

## How do I purchase this?

You can DM me ([Phantom#7151](https://dsc.gg/phantom)) via Discord to purchase this selfbot

## I can't DM you for some reason

Discord won't allow you to DM a user if you both are not in a Mutual Server. If you are facing any issues while DM-ing me, then join my [Discord Server](https://dsc.gg/phantom) and then DM me.

## How much commands does this selfbot have?

148 Commands as of in Version 1.4 (Latest Version). This might increase in the upcoming versions.

## Where do I view all the commands present in this selfbot?

You can view all the commands of this selfbot in the [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md) file.

## Is this worth it?

Of course! Almost every selfbot program are compiled together to mask the malacious code behind it. The open-source code on other repositories also might not work due to deprecation/unmaintainance of the program. So, it is better to buy a secure, working and maintained version [like this](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Cypher-Selfbot).
